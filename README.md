About
-----
A code repository written in Python for topological clustering presented in the ICLR 2022 paper:
- [Fast Topological Clustering with Wasserstein Distance](https://openreview.net/forum?id=0kPL3xO4R5)

This paper proposes a novel and computationally practical topological clustering
method that clusters complex networks with intricate topology using principled
theory from persistent homology and optimal transport.

Quick Start
-----------
1. Prerequisite: install _scikit-learn_
2. Execute `top_clustering.py` script for a demo of the topological clustering method
